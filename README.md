# MVC_CRUD
<h1>Basic MVC with CRUD operations</h1>
<p>One of my test MVC projects that I have created. The goal was to create a grid and allow editing of the columns which then is saved. This MVC example does not use a model for its table data entries. A further developed operational grid with CRUD functions populated by bound data from SQL Management can be found in my other respository BasketballMVC</p>
